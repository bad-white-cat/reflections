How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    If previous version didn't have this bug it probably will be found in changed content.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    History of changes can help to find bugs or easily return previous work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of manual: you can decide if changes should be saved and previous information 
    mey be lost. You can save new version in a separate file.
    Pros of automatic: changes are never forgotten to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Google saves files automatically and user can see what is being saved.
    Git commits are saved manually and user can avoid conflicts.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6 f19cb1b80fe27e938e4d72770ca0a42f25e99ecc

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can find commit where the bug appears first, and then compare it with the previous one. It could help find the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
